    "## Overview \n",
    "The goal of the project is to create a dashboard, which outputs an automated location analysis for a specified address. The tool should be designed such that it is useful for a variety of actors, for whom a structured assessment of a location presents beneficial (productivity improvement). For instance, it could be useful for: \n",
    "- the general public: e.g. holiday makers assessing hotels or someone who wants to assess a potential new flat\n",
    "- real estate agents researching attractive features of some property to publish in adverts\n",
    "- office managers assessing potential office locations or researching amenities, e.g. to provide some suggestion to employees\n",
    "- architects or city planners assessing the surrounding area of a site to inform decisions regarding potential uses\n",
    "- corporates assessing possible locations for\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, depending on the area of application, the requirements regarding outputs for such a tool/dashboard might differ, as are the relative importance of features considered. Such could, for instance, be a representative/central location, rental prices, public transport connectivity, and the location's surrounding area with all amenities that it has to offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the most basic version, the dashboard will showcase an objective assessment of the latter two features. Especially considering the surrounding area, the relative importance of different categories of amenities will differ depending on user groups. Thus, aside from inputting the location (in the format (street, no., city, (country))), the user should choose a selection of amenities in order to allow for some individualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "The output will be in the form of a sorted list/table including the identified feature and its distance as the crow flies and via road to the location. \n",
    "\n",
    "If time permits, measures will be created that give some insight into the performance of a location regarding the other features. Also, reference locations could be generated to provide some measure of relative performance.\n",
